# Rx MQTT
An [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) API for handling [MQTT](http://mqtt.org/) messages with an implementation using the [Paho](http://www.eclipse.org/paho/) Java MQTT library.

The main interface is `ObservableMqttClient`, which can be used to connect, publish and subscribe to a broker.

## API Changes in 1.1.0
In the 1.0.x branch, all of the `ObservableMqttClient` methods returned `Observable<T>` objects. In many cases, with RxJava 2.0 this was no longer the ideal type to return.

To support RxJava 2.0 the API has changed to make use of more appropriate reactive types.

1. Methods that returned `Observable<Void>` now return `Completable`. This new type is described in the [What's Different in 2.0](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/wiki/What's-different-in-2.0#completable) document for RxJava. This is really preferable and RxJava now [no longer supports null](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/wiki/What's-different-in-2.0#nulls). Methods affected are connect(), disconnect(), unsubscribe() and close().
2. The publish() method that returned a 'one-shot' `Observable<PublishToken>` now uses `Single<PublishToken>`. 
3. The subscribe() method now returns a `Flowable<MqttMessage>` rather than an `Observable<MqttMessage>`. `Flowable<T>` is a more suitable choice for supporting [backpressure](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/wiki/What's-different-in-2.0#backpressure).

## Backpressure
The subscribe() methods of `ObservableMqttClient` return a `Flowable<MqttMessage>` using the `BackpressureStrategy` provided (the default will be `BackpressureStrategy.BUFFER`. This is done via the `Flowable.create(FlowableEmitter<T>, BackpressureStrategy)` method [described in the RxJava 2 documentation](http://reactivex.io/RxJava/2.x/javadoc/io/reactivex/Flowable.html#create(io.reactivex.FlowableOnSubscribe,%20io.reactivex.BackpressureStrategy)).

If you subscribe to this `Flowable<MqttMessage>` with a `FlowableSubscriber<MqttMessage>` the `BackpressureStrategy` will be applied if you are unable to request messages fast enough. This is described [in the RxJava documentation](http://reactivex.io/RxJava/2.x/javadoc/io/reactivex/Flowable.html#subscribe(io.reactivex.FlowableSubscriber)). 

Note that the other subscribe() methods of `Flowable<T>` do not apply backpressure.

## Obtaining the client
The default Paho implementation of `ObservableMqttClient` can be obtained like this:

```java
final IMqttAsyncClient paho = new MqttAsyncClient(...);
final ObservableMqttClient client = PahoObservableMqttClient.builder(paho)
    ... // Customise
    .build();
```
The builder allows you to override the default `BackpressureStrategy` if desired (see above for a description of how backpressure works).

## Connecting
Asynchronously connect to the broker using an RxJava `Completable`.

```java
client.connect().subscribe(() -> {
  // do something on completion
}, e -> {
  // do something on error
});
```
## Publishing
Asynchronously publish a message to the broker using an RxJava `Single`.

```java
final MqttMessage msg = MqttMessage.create(...);
client.publish("mytopic", msg).subscribe(t -> {
  // do something on success
}, e -> {
  // do something on error
});
```
## Subscribing
Asynchronously subscribe to a topic (or topics) using an RxJava `Flowable`. For each message received, the subscriber is called with the message. The QOS level desired can be passed along with the topic.

```java
client.subscribe("mytopic", 1).subscribe(msg -> {
  // do something with message
  final byte[] body = msg.getPayload();
}, e -> {
  // do something on error
});
```

## Unsubscribing
Asynchronously unsubscribe from a topic (or topics) using an RxJava `Completable`.

```java
client.unsubscribe("mytopic").subscribe(() -> {
  // do something on disconnect completion
}, e -> {
  // do something on error
});
```

## Disconnecting
Asynchronously disconnect from the broker using an RxJava `Completable`.

```java
client.disconnect().subscribe(() -> {
  // do something on disconnect completion
}, e -> {
  // do something on error
});
```

## Closing
Asynchronously close the client and relase all resources using an RxJava `Completable`.

```java
client.close().subscribe(() -> {
  // do something on close completion
}, e -> {
  // do something on error
});
```
